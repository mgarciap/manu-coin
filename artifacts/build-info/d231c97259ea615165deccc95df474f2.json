@dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n and the account address.\n NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\n return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this\n function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient\n alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.\n ==== Gas Costs\n Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\n transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":1257,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1257,807,1282,885,1668],"name":"ERC20Snapshot","nameLocation":"2420:13:5","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"id":941,"libraryName":{"id":938,"name":"Arrays","nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":1646,"src":"2646:6:5"},"nodeType":"UsingForDirective","src":"2640:27:5","typeName":{"baseType":{"id":939,"name":"uint256","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"2657:7:5","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"id":940,"nodeType":"ArrayTypeName","src":"2657:9:5","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_array$_t_uint256_$dyn_storage_ptr","typeString":"uint256[]"}}},{"id":945,"libraryName":{"id":942,"name":"Counters","nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":1742,"src":"2678:8:5"},"nodeType":"UsingForDirective","src":"2672:36:5","typeName":{"id":944,"nodeType":"UserDefinedTypeName","pathNode":{"id":943,"name":"Counters.Counter","nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":1674,"src":"2691:16:5"},"referencedDeclaration":1674,"src":"2691:16:5","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_struct$_Counter_$1674_storage_ptr","typeString":"struct

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and total supply at the time are recorded for later access. This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting. In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \\\"double spend\\\" attack by reusing the same balance from different accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism. Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id and the account address. NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract. Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient alternative consider {ERC20Votes}. ==== Gas Costs Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry. There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\",\"events\":{\"Snapshot(uint256)\":{\"details\":\"Emitted by {_snapshot} when a snapshot identified by `id` is created.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"allowance(address,address)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-allowance}.\"},\"approve(address,uint256)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-approve}.

For more information on the signature format, see the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP section].\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol\":\"IERC20Permit\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf41ca991f30855bf80ffd11e9347856a517b977f0a6c2d52e6421a99b7840329\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b2717fd2bdac99daa960a6de500754ea1b932093c946388c381da48658234b95\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP6QVMn6UeA3ByahyJbYQr5M6coHKBKsf3ySZSfbyA8R7\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Arrays.sol":{"Arrays":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60566037600b82828239805160001a607314602a57634e487b7160e01b600052600060045260246000fd5b30600052607381538281f3fe73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212204e8cbc99cb2cf48cc9c2dd87fcc2564012c1e6927292328fbdb4217483ee25b364736f6c63430008090033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x56 PUSH1 0x37 PUSH1 0xB DUP3 DUP3 DUP3 CODECOPY DUP1 MLOAD PUSH1 0x0 BYTE PUSH1 0x73 EQ PUSH1 0x2A JUMPI PUSH4 0x4E487B71 PUSH1 0xE0 SHL PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 PUSH1 0x4 MSTORE PUSH1 0x24 PUSH1 0x0 REVERT JUMPDEST ADDRESS PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x73 DUP2 MSTORE8 DUP3 DUP2 RETURN INVALID PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0x4E DUP13 0xBC SWAP10 0xCB 0x2C DELEGATECALL DUP13 0xC9 0xC2 0xDD DUP8 0xFC 0xC2 JUMP BLOCKHASH SLT 0xC1 0xE6 SWAP3 PUSH19 0x92328FBDB4217483EE25B364736F6C63430008 MULMOD STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"244:3011:9:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;-1:-1:-1;;;244:3011:9;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212204e8cbc99cb2cf48cc9c2dd87fcc2564012c1e6927292328fbdb4217483ee25b364736f6c63430008090033","opcodes":"PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0x4E DUP13 0xBC SWAP10 0xCB 0x2C DELEGATECALL DUP13 0xC9 0xC2 0xDD DUP8 0xFC 0xC2 JUMP BLOCKHASH SLT 0xC1 0xE6 SWAP3 PUSH19 0x92328FBDB4217483EE25B364736F6C63430008 MULMOD STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"244:3011:9:-:0;;;;;;;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.9+commit.e5eed63a\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Collection of functions related to array types.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Arrays.sol\":\"Arrays\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Arrays.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x680e05d017ad097db73ea34e085c7c722c195c1f517f7311fcb3745571a18ba6\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://28f21c523cdacbe08106b89fd2aa4b1a85d1a22e0c80ec36628342cce546e67b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYGMF9UVC7GScniiN5KEFP1whSF4YYHDLJTGbxDarr47B\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd5c50c54bf02740ebd122ff06832546cb5fa84486d52695a9ccfd11666e0c81d\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://39e096c60a6eb1c6a257122d515496bd92d0c6a693a8f07acb6aa4b1263e95d4\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPs5trJBacCiSkezP6tpevapuRYWNY6mqSFzsMCJj7e6B\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa1e8e83cd0087785df04ac79fb395d9f3684caeaf973d9e2c71caef723a3a5d6\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://33bbf48cc069be677705037ba7520c22b1b622c23b33e1a71495f2d36549d40b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmct36zWXv3j7LZB83uwbg7TXwnZSN1fqHNDZ93GG98bGz\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol":{"Context":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.9+commit.e5eed63a\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data.
